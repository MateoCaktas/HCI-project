    <p class="testni-tekst"> Blues is a music genre and musical form originated in the Deep South of the United States around the 1870s. The genre developed from roots, and spirituals. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or "worried notes"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.</p>

A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Because it is very simple in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language and is often the first program people write.
